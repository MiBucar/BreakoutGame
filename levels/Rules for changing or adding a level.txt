TO ADD A NEW TYPE OF BRICK:

    <BrickType>
      <Id>I</Id>
      <Texture>images//textures//BrickInfinite.png</Texture>
      <HitPoints>Infinite</HitPoints>
      <HitSound>sounds//BrickHit.wav</HitSound>
	<BreakSound>none</BreakSound>
      <BreakScore>0</BreakScore>
    </BrickType>

paste this into the xml file and change the values and then in <Bricks> </Bricks> add the new Id and the game will dynamically update the bricks.

---------------------------------------------------

CHANGING ROWS AND COLUMNS:

To change rows or colums simply change the value of "RowCount" or "ColumnCount" in the xml file.
MAKE SURE TO increase number of bricks in <Bricks> </Bricks> depending on rows and columns after doing so to make it work! No need to change the code, game will dynamically update. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADDING NEW LEVEL:

in Level.h change the "std::string mLevels[3];" to the amount of levels you desire. 
in Level.cpp add a new level in the constructor by doing "mLevels[3] = "levels//Level4.xml";"
MAKE SURE that name of the file matches in editor
